# BreatheBack Demo Guide for Hack4Hope Judges

## 🎯 The Winning Pitch (30 seconds)

"BreatheBack gamifies air quality restoration, but what makes it powerful for cancer prevention is this: **we use AI to translate every action into real cancer risk reduction**. When teens tap a zone, they don't just see colors—they see exactly how vaping and smoking exposure affects lung cancer risk in their neighborhood. We're making cancer policy understandable and actionable through their own community data."

## 🎬 Demo Flow (5 minutes)

### 1. Show the Problem (30 sec)
- Open the app, show the heatmap
- "Youth are exposed to secondhand smoke and vaping aerosols daily, but they don't understand the cancer risk"
- "Traditional cancer education is abstract and boring"

### 2. Show the Solution (2 min)

**Part A: Gamified Engagement**
- "We gamify air quality with a Pokemon Go-style map"
- Tap a **yellow zone** (needs restoration)
- Point to the zone state indicator

**Part B: AI Cancer Translator (THE WINNING FEATURE)**
- Scroll to **"Cancer Prevention Impact"** section with 🎗️ icon
- Read the AI-generated explanation out loud
- **Key point**: "This is AI analyzing real zone data and explaining the cancer risk in terms teens understand"
- "It's not generic—it's personalized to THIS zone's exposure levels"

**Part C: Show Variety**
- Tap a **green zone** (healing) - show different explanation
- Tap a **blue zone** (recovered) - show positive message
- "The AI adapts to each zone's state, making cancer prevention personal"

### 3. Show the Actions (1 min)
- Go to Report tab
- "Users report vaping/smoking they see"
- "Then they get restoration actions to reduce cancer risk"
- Show action suggestions
- "Each action earns points AND reduces carcinogen exposure"

### 4. Connect to Cancer Policy (1 min)
- "This directly supports ACS CAN's mission"
- "We're teaching youth about:"
  - Secondhand smoke cancer risk
  - Vaping aerosol dangers
  - Environmental health equity
  - Community-level cancer prevention
- "They're not just playing a game—they're becoming cancer prevention advocates"

### 5. Show Impact (30 sec)
- Click points chip (top right)
- Show total points and actions completed
- "Every point represents reduced carcinogen exposure"
- "We're building a generation of cancer prevention activists"

## 🎬 Backup Demo Plan

If LLM is slow or fails:
1. Show the loading state: "Analyzing cancer risk..."
2. Explain: "The AI is analyzing this zone's exposure data"
3. If it loads: Great!
4. If it doesn't: "We have fallback messages, but the AI version is personalized to each zone's specific cancer risk profile"

## 📊 Impact Metrics to Mention

- "Each zone represents ~1 square kilometer"
- "Points directly correlate to reduced carcinogen exposure hours"
- "Users become cancer prevention advocates in their own neighborhoods"
- "Scalable to any city in America"

## 🏆 Closing Statement

"BreatheBack isn't just an app—it's a cancer prevention movement. We're taking ACS CAN's mission and putting it in the hands of the generation that needs it most. By combining gamification with AI-powered education, we're creating cancer prevention advocates one zone at a time. Thank you."
